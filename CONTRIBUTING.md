# Guidelines
- Contribute additions or changes via MRs or Issues
- Follow categorical ordering, only add categories when absolutely needed
- Use tags (#) for environments (e.g. #KDE, #NX, #Independent, etc.), no langauge tags
- Link application names to their offical websites whenever possible, fall back to repositories if needed
- Add a short description of the application after its tags, use the offical application slogan if it has one
